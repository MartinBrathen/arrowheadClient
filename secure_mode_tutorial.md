These instructions will be improved later, only for personal use at the moment

1. start core systems in secure mode
2. run ah_gen_system and give proper arguments for running in secure mode, can be found in config/default.conf
3. give read rights: chmod +r /etc/arrowhead/system/<system_name>/* , use +xr to really make sure this works
4. copy contents of /etc/arrowhead/system/<system_name>/ into config/certificates/testcloud1/ *optional*
5. Generate a public key from <system_name>.p12, or copy it from entry in table arrowhead_system in database and past into a file.
6. default.conf generated by ah_gen_system will contain propper passwords for keystores.
7. change original default.conf to point to new keystore, truststore, certificate and public key. <system_name>.p12 is key & trust
8. run the prosumer with -tls argument
